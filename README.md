# To-Do List Application

This project is a simple yet functional to-do list application built using React. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed by selecting a checkbox, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks when no longer needed. The application dynamically updates the task list and provides a real-time count of completed tasks displayed at the bottom.

With a clean and intuitive user interface, this to-do list enhances productivity by keeping track of tasks efficiently. React's state management ensures smooth interactions, making it easy for users to manage their daily tasks effectively.
